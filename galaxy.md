The Galaxy

### Stages of galaxy
One can draw a graph among the amount of energy left in the galaxy, and the technology/time. 

Stages of the galaxy. Don't have names for them yet, but may get one soon.
 - Beginning
    - First civs are discovering spaceflight
    - Barely any FTL or it is difficult
    - Empires are limited to about 1 or 2 planets.
 - Step 2
    - FTL becoming more common
    - First multi-planetary empires are starting to appear
    - Age of contact of other species (if there are any)
 - Step 3 (longest period, perhaps millions or even billions of years)
    - FTL is really common
    - Very little civs to contact left
    - Huge megaprojects, such as ringworlds and dyson spheres are forming
    - Planet and star destroying super weapons!!! Fun!!!
 - End game
    - Resources are nearly exhausted from the galaxy
    - Black holes are one of the only bodies left in the galaxy
