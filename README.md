Conquer Space Design
--------------

This will be the primary place for the design of the game Conquer Space. To see the actual development, see it here: <https://github.com/EhWhoAmI/Conquer-Space>

You can suggest more ideas in issues over at <https://github.com/EhWhoAmI/Conquer-Space-Design/issues>

The ideas will be slowly transitioned into projects, where they will be implemented in code.

This won't be too up to date, because sometimes, I make some game design changes, either because I thought of it at that moment, or it was easier to implement, but hopefully, over time, it should become a full image of what Conquer Space will be like. Everything is not final.
