Game Vision
-------------------

Conquer Space is a game where you would be able to play different parts of a galactic empire, the empire itself (what has been implemented), a corporation, or maybe even perhaps a political party; maybe even more stuff.

The game will try to simulate many of the aspects of what a real interstellar empire may have to deal with, such as logistics, or internal political struggles.
However, we will not do orbital mechanics (may do that in a plugin), because the rocket science is beyond me, and will only add to the complexity of the game. (Still be complicated)

What is the key focus of the game, is the interactions between people, and empires. Events happen because there is a preexisting condition, not by pure random chance.

Unlike most games, empires will not last for a long time. In most other games (Civ, Stellaris, etc.), empires that you play, and the AI last forever. 
The regimes stay the same for hundreds of years, and it just ends up with 3 huge blobs in a massive fight against each other. Also, allies tend to stay the same. 

So, to prevent that, we can add more internal unrest and other political events, detailed in [politics.md](politics.md)

Aliens will be possible, but they can also not exist. It should be possible to simulate a galaxy with fantasy like Star Wars, to be as 'realistic' as the Foundation series, where humans do not do much.

There are a few compromises temporal-wise that we will have to make in order to not have a hundred year wait. 

First, relativity WILL NOT EXIST. The science is beyond me, and I am sure the scale is confusing enough that people will not understand it. 

Next, it is assumed that FTL can be discovered relatively quickily (like a few hundred years from now)

Primitive life usually takes a long time (a matter of thousands, or even million years), so to make it simpler, those times may be shorterned.
